[**Purpose and Scope**
This document provides a high-level introduction to the Food Ordering application, a React-based food delivery platform that enables users to browse food items, manage a shopping cart, and place orders. The system implements a single-page application (SPA) architecture with client-side routing and centralized state management.

This overview covers the application's core purpose, user flows, technology stack, and architectural patterns. For detailed information about specific components, see Core Components. For state management implementation details, see State Management. For page-specific functionality, see Pages.

**Application Overview**
The Food Ordering application is a web-based platform that simulates a food delivery service interface. Users can browse food items organized by categories, add items to a shopping cart, and proceed through a checkout flow. The application emphasizes responsive design and uses modern React patterns including hooks and context for state management.

**User Flow Architecture**
The application implements three primary user flows that correspond to distinct pages managed by React Router:

**Technology Stack and Architecture**
The application uses a modern React ecosystem with the following key technologies:

Core Technologies
- **React 18.3:** Component-based UI framework with hooks
- **React Router DOM:** Client-side routing between pages
- **React Context API:** Global state management via StoreContext
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vite:** Build tool and development server

**State Management Overview**
The application implements centralized state management using React Context API through the StoreContext. This context provides:

- **Cart Management:** cartItems state and manipulation functions
- **Food Data:** Static food list with item details
- **Cart Calculations:** Total amount computation via getTotalCartAmount
  
The Navbar component demonstrates context integration by consuming cart data to display visual indicators when items are present in the cart src/components/Navbar/Navbar.jsx 78-83

**Application Entry Point**
The main application structure is defined in App.jsx, which establishes:

1. **Modal State Management:** showLogin state controls LoginPopup visibility
2. **Global Layout:** Fixed-width container with Navbar and Footer
3. **Route Configuration:** Three main routes (/, /cart, /order)
4. **Context Provider Wrapping:** StoreContext provides state to all child components

**Page Organization**
The application consists of three main pages that handle distinct user workflows:

| Page          | Route  | Purpose                     | Key Components                                          |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|Home.jsx       | /      | Food browsing and selection | Header, ExploreMenu, FoodDisplay, AppDownload           |
|Cart.jsx       | /cart  | Shopping cart management    | Cart item list, total calculations, checkout navigation |
|PlaceOrder.jsx | /order | Order finalization          | Delivery form, payment processing, order submission     |

Each page integrates with the global StoreContext for cart operations and uses the shared Navbar for navigation consistency.
